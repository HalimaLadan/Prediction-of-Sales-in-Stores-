#### **Project Overview**

This project is on analysing the trends on sales and the factors that affect sales returns by building a predictive model using existing data and training the model to give predictions on sales returns. This project was completed to fullfill the requirements of the Coding Dojo (Data Science) Boot Camp.

#### Description of the Data

Observations
The dataset contained 12 columns of features: 5 numeric and 7 object categories. Some of these features were not relevant to the prediction of sales and hence were not used.

***
#### **Data Cleaning Process**
+ Missing values were located and imputed+
+  Duplicates were identified and dropped+
+ Odd values explored and fixed+
+ Column datatypes were checked and changed as needed+

***
It was observed that the items with lower visibility distribution have the highest sale returns. So in order to maximise sales of items, the item visibility across has to have a low figure

***
The sales outlet distribution in regards to sales revealed that medium sized outlets makes the highest number of sales as compared to other types of outlets.

***
It was observed that out of all the outlet types,  Supermarket type 3 has the highest sales returns than any other type of outlet, while grocery stores makes the least sales
